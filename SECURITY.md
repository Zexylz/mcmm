## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead, please report it via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the "Security" tab of this repository. This is the preferred method as it allows for private discussion and coordinated disclosure.
2. **Private Contact**: If you cannot use GitHub's reporting tool, please reach out to the repository maintainers through their profile contact information.

### What to include in your report

To help us address the issue quickly, please include:
- A descriptive title.
- Clear steps to reproduce the vulnerability (PoC).
- Potential impact if the vulnerability is exploited.
- Any suggested mitigations.

## Response Process

After receiving a report, we will:
1. Acknowledge receipt within 48-72 hours.
2. Investigate the issue and confirm the vulnerability.
3. Work on a fix and test it.
4. Issue a new release with the security fix.
5. Provide credit to the reporter (unless they wish to remain anonymous).

## Ground Rules

- Coordinate disclosure: Give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before sharing it publicly.
- No disruptive testing: Do not perform tests that could degrade the service or impact other users.
- Privacy: Do not attempt to access or leak user data.

Thank you for helping keep MCMM secure!
